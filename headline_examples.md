# Headline Style Changes

## Summary of Changes Made

I've modified your `generate_script.py` to encourage more natural, conversational headlines instead of formal title-style headlines.

## Before vs After Examples

### Old Style (Unnatural):
- "Uni-MoE: Revolutionary Multimodal Architecture"
- "The Problem with Traditional Scaling"
- "GPT-4: Advanced Language Modeling"
- "Transformer Architecture Overview"
- "Training Methodology Results"

### New Style (Natural Sentences):
- "Today we're exploring how Uni-MoE creates a revolutionary approach to multimodal AI architectures"
- "Let's understand why traditional scaling methods create significant computational challenges"
- "Let's explore how GPT-4 revolutionizes language modeling with advanced techniques"
- "Here's how the Transformer architecture changes everything we know about neural networks"
- "Now we'll discover what makes their training methodology so effective"

## What Changed in the Code

### 1. Updated Field Descriptions
- Added specific guidance for Headlines in the `ScriptComponent` model
- Headlines should be "complete, natural sentences that could be spoken aloud"

### 2. Modified System Prompts
- Added explicit instructions: "For Headlines: Write complete, conversational sentences that sound natural when spoken"
- Provided starter phrases: "Let's explore how...", "Now we'll discover...", "Here's why this approach..."

### 3. Updated Examples
- Changed all example headlines in both `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT_NO_LINK`
- Converted title-case phrases to full conversational sentences

## Benefits of Natural Headlines

1. **More Engaging**: Sounds like a real person talking, not reading titles
2. **Better Flow**: Transitions naturally between sections
3. **Accessible**: Easier for viewers to follow and understand
4. **YouTube-Friendly**: Matches the conversational style popular on educational YouTube channels
5. **Narrator-Friendly**: Easier for text-to-speech or human narrators to deliver naturally

## Usage

The AI model will now generate headlines that:
- Use complete sentences
- Start with engaging phrases like "Let's explore...", "Here's why...", "Now we'll discover..."
- Sound natural when spoken aloud
- Avoid abbreviated title-case formatting
- Flow better with the surrounding text content

Your script generation should now produce much more natural-sounding headlines that feel like part of a conversation rather than formal section titles!
