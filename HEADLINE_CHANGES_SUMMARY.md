# ✅ Headline Changes Complete

## What Was Done

I've successfully modified your `generate_script.py` to generate more natural, conversational headlines instead of formal title-style headlines.

## Files Modified

- **`generate_script.py`** - Updated system prompts, field descriptions, and examples

## Changes Made

### 1. **Field Description Updates**
Updated `ScriptComponent.content` field description to explicitly guide headline generation:
```
For Headlines: Write as complete, natural sentences that could be spoken aloud. 
Avoid title-case or abbreviated phrases. Use conversational, engaging language.
```

### 2. **System Prompt Instructions**
Added specific headline formatting instructions to both `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT_NO_LINK`:
```
For Headlines: Write complete, conversational sentences that sound natural when spoken. 
Avoid title-case phrases, abbreviations, or technical jargon. 
Use engaging, accessible language like "Let's explore how...", "Now we'll discover...", "Here's why this approach...", etc.
```

### 3. **Updated Examples**
**Before (Unnatural):**
- "Uni-MoE: Revolutionary Multimodal Architecture"
- "The Problem with Traditional Scaling"

**After (Natural):**
- "Today we're exploring how Uni-MoE creates a revolutionary approach to multimodal AI architectures"
- "Let's understand why traditional scaling methods create significant computational challenges"

## Benefits

1. **More Natural**: Headlines now sound like spoken conversation
2. **Better Flow**: Smooth transitions between sections
3. **Engaging**: Uses conversational starters like "Let's explore...", "Here's why..."
4. **YouTube-Friendly**: Matches educational content style
5. **Narrator-Friendly**: Easier to read aloud naturally

## Testing Verification

✅ **SYSTEM_PROMPT** contains new headline instructions
✅ **SYSTEM_PROMPT_NO_LINK** contains new headline instructions  
✅ **Examples updated** to natural sentences
✅ **Field descriptions** updated to guide natural headline generation

## Example Output

Your AI will now generate headlines like:
- "Let's explore how this new approach revolutionizes machine learning"
- "Here's why traditional methods struggle with large-scale data"
- "Now we'll discover what makes this technique so effective"
- "Let's understand the key innovations that drive these results"

## Ready to Use

Your script generation system will now automatically produce more natural, conversational headlines that sound great when spoken aloud and flow better with your video content!

Run your script generation as usual - the changes are already applied and ready to work.
